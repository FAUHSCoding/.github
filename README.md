--About Us--
The High School Coding Club is a community of passionate students interested in computer programming and
technology. Our mission is to foster a collaborative and inclusive environment where members can:

- Learn new programming languages, tools, and techniques.
- Work on coding projects individually or in teams.
- Participate in coding competitions, hackathons, and challenges.
- Share knowledge, resources, and insights with fellow members.
- Connect with like-minded individuals who share a passion for coding.

--Getting Started--

*If you're new to the club or GitHub in general, don't worry! We've got you covered. Here's how you can
get started:*

1. Join the Organization: If you're not already a member of our GitHub organization, send a request to join.
Once your request is approved, you'll have access to all the repositories and resources.

2. Explore Repositories: Take a look at our repositories to find ongoing projects, coding resources, and more.
Feel free to clone, fork, and contribute to any repository that interests you.

3. Create Your Repository: If you have an idea for a coding project, feel free to create your own repository
within the organization. This is your space to work on your project, collaborate with others, and showcase your skills.

4. Engage in Discussions: We use GitHub Discussions to have conversations, ask questions, and share ideas.
Don't hesitate to start a discussion thread if you have something to share or need help.

5. Participate in Events: Keep an eye out for coding competitions, hackathons, and other events organized by the club.
It's a great opportunity to challenge yourself, learn, and have fun.

6. Contribute and Collaborate: Collaboration is at the heart of open source and coding clubs. If you see a project that
interests you, feel free to contribute by submitting pull requests. Don't be afraid to ask for help or offer assistance
to fellow members.

7. Code of Conduct: Our club follows a Code of Conduct to ensure a respectful and inclusive environment for all members.
Please read and adhere to it in all interactions within the club.

--Communications--

We have a Discord server where we discuss most of the important stuff, but you can also check out an Instagram account
made by one of the members. Unfortunately, Discord does not allow invites longer than 30 days for servers that are not
classified as "Communities".

if you want to follow, the handle is @fauhscoding
or use this link: https://www.instagram.com/fauhscoding/

Issues: If you encounter a problem with a specific repository, you can open an issue in that repository. Be sure to
provide detailed information about the issue.

--Have Fun!--

Remember, coding is not just about writing lines of code; it's about creativity, problem-solving, and learning. So, have fun
exploring, experimenting, and collaborating. We can't wait to see the incredible projects you'll create and the skills you'll develop.
